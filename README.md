KeePassMini (formerly IOSKeePass)
===========

12.03.2023
We had to change the app name because we violated the
Apple App Store Policy 5.2.5 - Legal - Intellectual Property.
Your app metadata contains content that resembles designs or terms used for Apple products and services, which may cause confusion among users. Specifically, your metadata includes:

- Terms for iOS in the app name in an inappropriate manner.
- Terms for iOS in the app name displayed on the device. 

for this reason we call IOSKeePass after KeePassMini.


Free KeePass ist a fork of MinKeePassMini, i do it, because i find that this Software is great stuff for password storing
and sensible data to a local file, and only in the cloud with a strong enrcyption, also i mean, it was free and it should be keep for free in future.
I have create a new repo on Github, because the original Github project was setting to read only, and i canÂ´t support the original Software development.

  The Time-based One-time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an extension of the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) that generates a one-time password (OTP) by instead taking         
  uniqueness from the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[1] standard RFC 6238,
  [1] is the cornerstone of Initiative for Open Authentication (OAUTH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication (2FA) systems.
